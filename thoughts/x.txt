A: I have experienced many notes being played together and I know which note will proces the effect I am looking for - so I play it.

B: I am aware of the current note being played - Because of a physical phenomena of the summation of two waves I have built some understanding of how complex or simple wave formed by their summation will be - I have associated simplicity with consonance and complexity with dissonance - I have an implicit set of rules which order the intervals - I am aware of the effect that this consonance or dissonance will have on me - I believe it will have a similar effect on others - Therefore to express how I feel and how I want others to feel I will play this note.

Music evolves
